We're not doing it for that at all,==\n==we don't even need a thank you. We're doing it because we've been waiting for this, gearing up for this, learning,== ==researching, building up a skillset to be able to contribute, in some small way,==\n==to righting our world for our entire lives. Many are not even Americans.==\n==We, those in this category, TRUST the Plan.==\n==We TRUST your team.==\n==We TRUST POTUS.==\n==We also TRUST the network working with him/you worldwide.==\n==We know there will never be full disclosure and why that is obvious it cannot happen.==\n==We know that there are things we will never know or understand, pieces in the puzzle we likely will never have,==\n==and that's ok.==\n\n==Just want to make that clear and say thanks for including us,== \n==giving us the incredible opportunity to actually help in something so worthwhile.\"==\n\n==Those who cannot understand that we cannot simply start arresting w/o first ensuring the safety & well-being of the population, shifting the narrative, removing those in DC through resignation to ensure success, defeating ISIS/MS13 to prevent fail-safes, freezing assets to remove network-to-network abilities, kill off COC to prevent top-down comms/org, etc etc. should not be participating in discussions.==\n==Q==\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////break\n \n'''There's 1 Rule on /QResearch/'''\n>>321317\n'''(Also, The Golden Rule)'''\n \n==Q's Private Board==\n>>>/greatawakening/\nCurrent Tripcode: !UW.yye1fxo\n \n==Latest Q Posts==\n'''Monday, 12.2.18'''\n>>351447 rt >>351343\n>>351282 rt >>351238\n>>350607 rt >>350576 \n>>350551 rt >>350525 rt >>350504\n>>>/greatawakening/87\n>>350084\n>>347137 rt >>346987\n\n'''Sunday, 11.2.18'''\n>>343459 rt >>343395   Max cap\n>>343065 rt >>343004   Double meanings\n>>343195 rt >>343080   We are with you, Patriot\n>>343356               Attack ongoing\n>>343304 rt >>343156   one simple fact\n>>343019 rt >>342919   Chatter amongst those in control\n>>342895 rt >>342747   '''THIS board'''\n>>>/greatawakening/86  United Airlines to GITMO\n>>>/greatawakening/85  We don't say his name\n>>>/greatawakening/84  What if Snowden was still a clown\n>>340719 rt >>340695\n>>340471 rt >>340441 & >>325370 \n>>340398               Snowden\n>>>/greatawakening/83  Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n>>339791 rt >>339722\n>>339775 rt >>339583\n>>339563 rt >>339453\n>>>/greatawakening/82\n>>339123\n>>338960 rt >>338623\n>>337245               Re-read past crumbs\n>>337117 rt >>337108\n>>337096               Find the passenger list\n\n'''Saturday, 10.2.18'''\n>>326006 Public: FBI/DOJ/O-WH/SD\n>>325862 Google / CIA web monitoring investment\n>>325644 globaleaks.org\n>>325580 Mess with the best, die like the rest\n>>325453 Seals are wonderful creatures\n>>325370 You will cease to exist\n>>325300 Thank you Dopey\n>>325284 Clown black op sites.
