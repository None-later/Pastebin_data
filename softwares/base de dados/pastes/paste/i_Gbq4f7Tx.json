 "text": "Chen An had a hero's soul\nA Longshang man, so brave and bold.\nAlthough a slender fellow he\nHow greatly did his stomach feed!\nHe loved the men of his command\nAnd kept them safe within his hands.\nA feisty piebald he did ride\nAn iron saddle sat astride.\nSo swift he waved his fearsome blade\nA deadly price it made men pay.\nAnd as his spear swung to and fro\nHe plunged it into every foe.\nTen duels he'd fight of ten bouts each\nWith vict'ry never out of reach.\nBut barely now had swords been crossed\nAlas! this time that spear was lost.\nHe left his horse among the strife\nAnd sought some place to save his life.\nBut t'was not life, but death he found\nAnd now his head hangs in the town.\nEternal does that river flow\nFrom west to east it always goes.\nYou cannot turn it back again\nMuch less change the fate of men!",
