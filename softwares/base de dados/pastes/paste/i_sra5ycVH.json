 "text": "Tim walked inside and dropped the heavy bag onto the floor. Three cats quickly grabbed it and dragged it into a wadrobe. Then the old lady finally spoke.\nHere is a gift for your kindness.\nBut something seemed wrong about the way she talked. It was more of a purr then actual words. And it was also weird how she covered pretty much her whole body with clothes. Tim hesitantly put his hand out but then relised it was rude, so put his hand down. Tim was shocked to see the old lady pull our a solid bar of gold! He was also shocked to see how she carried it with a paw? So he decided and pulled of the hood revealing... A CAT, AND ANOTHER CAT, and another? All the other cats then quickly grouped together and ran out of the house. Tim headed towards the abandoned bag, no wonder it was so heavy, but that didnt matter, he had to report this and fast. How can it possibly be full of gold? He reached for his phone, but it wasnt there. Suddenly a query silence took over the deserted street. What in the world has happened? Tim pondered.",
