 "text": "Examining the metal housing closely, you read the fine inscriptions near the operational end of this foreign weapon: \"XR High-intensity/Generation Eighty-four Light-focused LASER beam projector\". It's a laser rifle. You're familiar with the technology, and have an adequate understanding of its mechanics; these projectors, along with most laser weaponry, convert energy from stored power cells into light, which can then be forced through progressively more-intricate magnification lenses before it is finally amplified by applied radiation at its point of projection. The resultant beam is searing-hot, easily capable of destroying organic tissue like your own. Given time, it could even cut through panes of metal, depending on their thickness. As is true with all lasers, the emitted beam would, almost by definition, be perfectly accurate.",
