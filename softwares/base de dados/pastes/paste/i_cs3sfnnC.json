It's the punky, alternative part of the city with lots of cool shops, vegan places etc. and also features the tv tower with the super weird and creepy baby-art-installation on it\n\nNational Monument on Vtkov is the little hill right in the city. Pretty cool view.\n\nThe hill across the river to the west is the Strahov area, that has one of the worlds biggest stadiums (slow clap), but also a really nice park to walk up/down to or from the city called Petn Park.\n\nNorth of that is the Letna Gardens/Park that has a huge ass metronom and from that a nice view of the city.\n\nAlso the classical tourist stuff: Karluv most, the karl's bridge, franz kafka museum, the castle etc. - can't miss all that.\n\n-- BRNO --\nFOOD\nForkys (it's also in Prague)\nhttp://www.forkys.eu/",
