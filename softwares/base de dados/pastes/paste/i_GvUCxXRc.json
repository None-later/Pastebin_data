While this does not express itself in a reduction of actual skills or attributes, when struck by a fire-type attack that would deal at least two wounds, Rider receives two extra wounds and a [Major Injury] with no save. When struck in this manner, Rider also loses the effect of Season Attunement (Winter) for five turns.",
