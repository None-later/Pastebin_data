Designed for professional web developers and programmers, MAMP PRO allows easy installation and administration of their development environment.\n\n--Multi-PHP\nRun different versions of PHP at once\nMAMP Pro has always offered multiple versions of PHP. This was convenient if you had different projects using different versions of PHP, but required a restart of MAMP PRO when you wanted to change projects. If, for instance, you needed to work on a host which used a different version of PHP, you had to restart the servers and change the PHP version to work on that particular virtual host. With the new MAMP PRO you can configure your PHP versions on a per host basis using CGI Mode. Now you can conveniently switch between virtual hosts using different PHP versions on the fly.\n\n--Virtual Server\nSet up any number of virtual servers\nYou can set up and test any number of virtual servers without the danger of affecting your live system. The local name resolution is performed by MAMP PRO. For each project, you can create a virtual host and conveniently test your programs in detail. Whether you create a page using a CMS, integrate a shopping-cart, or create a WordPress template - MAMP PRO is there to provide the perfect test environment. With unlimited server-hosts you can separate all your projects and make them accessible to your local network or even the internet. To simulate a very authentic environment, MAMP PRO can activate the local mail server, as well as the sending of emails via PHP.\n\n--Extras\nInstall Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, etc with just one click\nAn Extra is a collection of files or library, which has been tested and configured by the MAMP PRO team. When setting up a new virtual host you can also choose and Extra which will automatically be installed. You can also install Extras on existing hosts. The selection of extras is always being updated and expanded.\n\n--Dynamic DNS\nAllow External Access\nWith MAMP PRO, you can easily connect your local server to the internet with an existing Dynamic DNS provider.

With the option to set up many virtual hosts, you can easily offer alternative configurations or suggestions. With MAMP PRO 3.0 the DNS-O-Matic service is integrated. Now you have a huge selection of Dyn-DNS service providers, many of which are free of charge.\n\n--Postfix / SMTP\nTest PHP scripts with a Mail-Server\nEvery OS X & Windows computer comes pre-installed with a default Mail-Server. This Mail-Server can be activated through the MAMP PRO interface and its functionality used via PHP scripts. With this Mail-Server you can setup up an account through a host provider.
