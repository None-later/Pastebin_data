 "text": "INNOVATIVE IDEA : FREE-FOR-ALL SURF\n\nWhat ?\n------\n\nA free for all plugin. Everyone vs everyone. \n\nWhy ?\n-----\n\nSurfing has never been a team based game mod. There is no strategy involved, people simply try to kill the most ennemies. It would bring something different in surf, bring people to spacedout servers and a lot of surf problems will be fixed (see pros section).\n\nHow ?\n-----\n\nEveryone could shoot at everyone. Spawns won't change but Spawn protections will last more to avoid spawnkilling.\n\nPros\n-----\n\n* No more endless rounds.\n* Rounds will be more dynamic\n* No more unfair teams\n* No more noobs carried by good people\n* A rank system that actually means something\n* More skill based\n* No more camping \n* Could be the difference from other servers that will bring people to spacedout servers\n* Can work on either multimap or greatriver maps\n* Noobs will improve caster\n* Pros will have actual challenge cause they will always fight eachother\n\nCons\n-----\n\nFucking none",
