HP xx v-skill xx P, upball (300, 500) - Note that super cancel is impossible here since you connect late, so you to juggle straight into super from v-skill. This is technically damage optimal but it won't always be possible if you're not close, so I'll list some other stuff.\nst. HP (CC) xx f+KKK, st. MK xx HK xx HP (247, 396)\nst. HP (CC) xx f+KKK, cr.
