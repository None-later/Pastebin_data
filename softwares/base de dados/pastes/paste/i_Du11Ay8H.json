 "text": "Re: motivation for computing science\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing this letter as a part of my application for computing science. I decided to study abroad so that I can step out of my comfort zone. I know that studying abroad will sharpen my English and the degree will be more valuable from a country that has a historical prowess in education. \n\nIn school I have enjoy solving math equations and solution methods (algorithms) in many different ways. Because of this, I can solve problems in unique way and utilize every given tools full potential. Computing science is also a relevant education hence the increasing speed of information in our society that is being driven by technology. This fact also makes this bachelors great for long term because of its increasing value with time, you wont ever feel cheated of education.\n\nNijmegen is an old city that i think has its charm and Radboud has more of a academic way of learning which will better suit my way of studying. The individual tutoring sessions and the multitude of choices what to study make Radboud University a better choice than most schools.\n\nI am a very goal oriented person and can make the best out of a dire situation. I am quick witted when I get used to the study rhythm and can easily take a leading role in a group if necessary. \n\nKind regards,\nJuris Kristaps Surums",
