 "text": " I find it pretty fascinating that we both kind of came to our beliefs in a reaction sense; reacting to people we thought were trying to force our brains a certain way.\n\nMy view so far:\n\nThe lie is actually several layers deep; when realizing how \"aggressively capitalist\" we were I was in the same boat as you; until I realized people like\n\nRussian Infiltrators\nDocumentary: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4YtgA2jnu4\n\n&\n\nCommunist Zionist schools that fled eastern europe\nDocumentary:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIdBuK7_g3M\n\nwere aggressively pushing the narrative that we were \"aggressively capitalist\" for many years in the 1900s; producing the hippy-enlightenment movement we see dominating today.\n\nNow if you accept far-left economics to be a form of weakness; then that suggests foreign agents were and are trying to break down the country from the inside via politics.\n\nI see it as; we're led to believe how overly capitalist shit is so that we rise up against it. With the illusion that left economics don't exist politically (which they do); and that all \"democrats\" are just pushing for \"equality\" rather than socialism or communism. When in fact; pushing for \"equality' is merely the first domino in making people want \"economic equality\"; and then your social leftism quickly leads to economic leftism.",
