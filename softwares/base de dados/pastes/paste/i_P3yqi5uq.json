With extremely similar powers and wildly contrasting personalities, you are sure to get on like a house on fire. You and Dark Jumper are connected though. If your soul is ever trapped and rendered without conscious thought, so too will Dark Jumper fall. Similarly, if you die, so too does Dark Jumper. This isnt a complete link though, injuries and the like will not transfer between you.",
