I'm talking about /r/deepfakes, and the others that followed soon after.\n\nThe ban was a result of a mod (!) /u/ShaneH7646 posting (under a different name) deepfake vid made using photos of underage natalie portman. The vid wasn't cp, but the face pasted on it was from a minor. \nThe mod then ratted to reddit admins to ban the community, and also advised them on what other subreddits should be banned, and they promptly did. The subreddits, among others, were /r/celebfakes (which existed for 7 years without a problem) and also /r/doppelbangher, that contained no porn, just suggestions on pornstars that looked like other people (celebs, somebodys friends, etc.).\n\nWhat a fucking little bitch that guy is.",
