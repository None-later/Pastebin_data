 "text": "PROMPOSAL PLAN:\n1. Walk out the door with her and ask: Hey __, can I talk to you for a bit? Lets go out there to the side.\n\n2. Pull her aside (outside).\n\n3. Ask her: So, Senior Prom is coming up and I was wondering if you would like to go with me\n\nIf she says no:\n\t- (Smiling) Alright __, no worries. It was worth asking you. Anyone who goes to prom with you is lucky since youre such a nice \t\t\t\n      girl. I have to get going now and I hope you enjoy your Winter Break (Walk away).\n\nIf she says yes:\n\t- (Smiling) Awesome, thanks for accepting my offer! We should buy our prom tickets soon before they are sold out. We can buy them \t\n      online through the online student store. We should take prom pictures in March as I will have the photographer lined up. Anyways, \n      I have to get going and I hope you enjoy your Winter Break (Walk away).\n\nIf she asks why: \n\t- (Smiling) Because I think youre such a nice and pretty girl. And to be honest, I cant think of anyone better than you to go to \n      prom with me. It would be great if you went with me, but if you cant, Im totally fine with it.",
