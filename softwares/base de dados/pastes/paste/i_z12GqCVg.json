 "text": "  I've had an innate fascination with technology since I was young. New projects and learning opportunities excite me greatly, which is exactly why I am so interested in a NASA internship. It is compelling to take on a project that I can learn from, while contributing to NASA's mission. \n   On top of my interest in NASA's research projects, I see an opportunity for personal and professional growth through an internship experience. I'm interested in what could be gained from learning about how a large STEM organization like NASA operates. An internship would be a great chance to develop career skills outside of a college environment. It would also be inspiring to work alongside NASA engineers and researchers. The opportunity to learn from such an environment is exciting and meaningful to me.",
