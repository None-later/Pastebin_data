 "text": "I love you very very very very much,\nyou are the best thing that has ever happened to me and i really want to spend the rest of my life with you, \nI have never had this much fun in my life \nand i can't wait to see what else we will do in the coming months.\nI swear I couldn't love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow <3\n\nWhen you read this dont say anything, i want you to write something aswell and see if when i read it\n\n\nNever before in my life had I been treated like my gender identity in real life, only online. This past week I spent with you was the best week I ever had, not only did you encourage me to act like I am, but you helped me pick out some things so that I could slowly get more feminine clothing. I dont think I could ever be as happy as I am right now, and I truly believe that Im extremely blessed to have met you.\nYou truly are this worlds most beautiful woman in my eyes, and as time goes on, I start to believe more and more that our meeting was destined, and so was me falling in love with you.\nIn the future, I will undergo many changes, but I promise you one thing - if my love for your changes, it will only become bigger and stronger, and I hope that during my second puberty, you will be by my side during it, be it on the good or bad moments. I will\n\nI love you, Luna.",
