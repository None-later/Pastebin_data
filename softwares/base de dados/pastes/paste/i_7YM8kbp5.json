 "text": "I would definitely prefer something a bit more time oriented than number oriented.   In general, I think users would prefer a more concrete value they can plan around as well.      Something like \"for one year from initial release\" or similar.     Saying \"until 2.10 is out\" always brings up the discussion of \"well, when is that?\".\n\n\n<commercial interest hat on>\nAnd, to be honest, I plan on supporting any branch for longer than that if a customer pays me enough to do so.    Thus, the wording should likely be more along the lines of:\n\n \"for at least one year from initial release\" \n\nto make it open for those in the community to continue providing patches and such on even older releases as demand arises.",
