 "text": "STAR WARS: GALAXY OF HEROES\n\"ROJO ONE\" RAID RULES\n \nHEROIC RANCOR\nDo Zero damage on the raid boss. Attack with a team of only one character, and damage the guards on either side of the boss if you have to make an attack move. When your character dies, you will be on the leader board with 0 damage. If all participants have 0 damage, raid reward payouts Will be randomized and when the raid is defeated (it is solo'd by one predetermined person) everyone has an equal shot at higher tier rewards. We do this because the raid is far too easy, and this makes it fair for everyone.\n \nNote: when you attempt to attack with one character, you will get a popup warning that your team is incomplete. This is fine. Accept and continue. *DO NOT USE* a character with a counter attack or group damaging attack.\n \nTANK TAKEDOWN\nRancor Rules first 24hr. Send 1 character, do Zero damage on the boss first 24 hours after raid launch to give time for everyone to join for rewards. After 24 hours, you may attack and do as much damage with as many teams as you would like. We do this because we are preparing for Heroic Tank (HAAT), and normal tank can be defeated in only a few hours, which is not enough time for everyone in the guild to join for rewards. When we are able to complete HAAT these rules will be revised.\n \nIF YOU MESS UP and do damage on the rancor raid boss (or tank boss before 24hr), simply acknowledge it in Guild Chat so that leaders know and remember for next time. We all make mistakes, but purposefully ignoring these rules or making a habit of messing up will get you removed from the guild.",
