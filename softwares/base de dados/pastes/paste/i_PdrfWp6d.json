 "text": "Ennis Hill 2yo filly 2-1-0-0 $95,750\n\nSummary & Overview\nAdded 07/02\n3rd February\nCaulfield the 1.5 length winner over 1000 metres. +2.7 lengths above benchmark ranked 12th on the day\n\nExcellent 2nd career start off a 7 week break where she's improved 4.8 lengths, and from a pure IVR data perspective a better performance than KINKY BOOM a race earlier. However we need to underline this was in the \"1000 metre island\" and she has to be able to drag that figure to 1200 to win the Blue Diamond if they head straight there and that is a challenge. Big mid race from -0.5 to the 800 to +4.4 at the 400 and +2.0 last 400. The micro look at the last 200 splits give us some concern. She lost 1.4 lengths from the 400 to 200 and 1.1 lengths over the last 200. At best +2 to +2.5 at 1200, but while she's a speed filly with wins to come, we have distance doubts at 1200 if into the big race next start.\n16th December\nCaulfield 2.4 lengths 4th over 1100. -2.1 lengths below benchmark ranked 47th best of the day\n\nStarted $4:50 favourite and produced some speed at +3.1 to the 800, but then fell right away with -1.6 to the 400 and -1.1 last 400. 22nd best last 800 of the day. 18th best last 400",
