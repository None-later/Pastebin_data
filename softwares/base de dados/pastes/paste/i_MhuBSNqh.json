 "text": "Nostradamus 10-72\nTHE REAL TRANSLATION OF \"CXQ72\"\n\n\"L'an mil neuf cens nonante neuf sept mois Du ciel viendra un grand \nRoy deffraieur resusciter le grand Roy d'Angolmois. Avant apres \nMars regner par bon heur\".\n\n\"In the year 1999 the seven month, from the sky will come a great\nKing to bear/pay costs to resurrect the great King of Angolmois. \nBefore and after Mars reign merrily\".\n\nNo \"King of Terror\" here; the word \"deffraieur\" meaning to bear\npay costs (to defray), was miscopied as \"d'effrayeur\", apostrophe\nadded and wrong spelling that doesn't exist in the original text, from\nwhence the word \"terror\" was thus inserted into the meaning.\n\n\n The most logical translation seems to be known, this is an !!alternative and far fetched!! translation.\n\nIf d'effraieur means -> to pay costs -> to may relate to bitcoin.\n To resurrect the King of Angolmois ->to create an era without war, since who want to pay the costs with a non-deflationairy/non-printable currency.\n1999 would be more or less an indicator if a big era change, not necessarily that specifc year.\n Before, and after this period of time, war(mars) will be present again.\n\n  See also, Quatrain I-53.",
