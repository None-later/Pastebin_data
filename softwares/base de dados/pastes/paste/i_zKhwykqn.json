Beam between bulkheads is at 24.2m to accomodate this.\nA 178mm gun was tested on a military tractor with maximum elevation of 40 degrees - I would try and match this, especially as the real-life 16-inch/50 Mark 2 turrets have -4/+40 degree elevation. Range data is available at this 40 degree elevation.\nAs the 4\"/50 Mark 10 mounting doesn't exist, I would like to try and achieve the +85 degrees the 3-inch/50 is capable of.",
